                <h3 class="about-title-h2">10 REASONS HOMEMADE IS BEST.</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>1. HANDMADE IS THOUGHTFUL.</dt>
                    <dd>Each item is a creation of love and skill. The artisan uses all their abilities to
                    create a beautiful item that celebrates their craftsmanship. They have imagined each
                    piece, from beginning to end. The thoughtfulness extends to the buyer, who appreciates
                    all the effort and skill.</dd>
                    <dt>2. HANDMADE IS HIGH QUALITY.</dt>
                    <dd>Hand created products are made to the highest quality because the maker understand the
                    value of each piece. Remember paying less means your getting less. Hand crafted work
                    is built to last. It is not there until the next upgrade or until the guarantee runs out. </dd>
                    <dt>3. HANDMADE IS GREEN.</dt>
                    <dd>There is not large factory or industry behind hand made. Generally the products are
                    produces and sold in one region or home town. Products pass through fewer hands than
                    big companies, creating a smaller footprint. Who doesnâ€™t value that today?</dd>
                    <dt>4.HANDMADE IS SUSTAINABLE.</dt>
                    <dd>Creators of handmade items care greatly about the quality of the materials they use. 
                    They spend time looking for recyclable packaging, Eco-friendly suppliers or local 
                    producers.  Where there is an over production of certain goods their is the likely 
                    hood of unethical sourcing. The better the materials, the better the end product.</dd>
                    <dt>5. HANDMADE IS SUPPORTIVE.</dt>
                    <dd>When buying a hand crafted item you are supporting the local economy, the local
                    community and a real person. Each sale makes a huge difference in their lives. You 
                    are supporting a child going to school or a meal for their table, not a huge corporate 
                    brand.</dd>
                    <dt>6. HANDMADE CAN BE CUSTOMISED.</dt>
                    <dd>This is my favourite reason for buying hand-made. You can make it your own!
                    Personalising your piece creates a feeling of pride that it is unique to you. 
                    Every artisan wants to see a happy customer. By helping create your very own bespoke 
                    item they attain this happiness.</dd>
                    <dt>7. HANDMADE HAS A STORY.</dt>
                    <dd>Hand crafted items are created under one roof, by one maker. By supporting the maker, 
                    you support their creativity and skill. You get to shake the hand of the creator of 
                    your beautiful piece. The Artisan has spent many nights learning a skill, perfecting 
                    a technique and pouring their passion into what they make. Your gift has a very special 
                    story of a lifetime woven into it.</dd>
                    <dt>8. HANDMADE KEEPS TRADITIONAL SKILLS AND CRAFTS ALIVE.</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, you support learning, creating and history by allowing craftsmen to practice, 
                    showcase and carry on traditions. We are a society that values the art and creativity 
                    and by buying handmade you support the continuation of the arts for the next generation.</dd>
                    <dt>9. HANDMADE IS UNIQUE.</dt>
                    <dd>Handmade is not mass produced. Each item is a unique display of craftsmanship. Each 
                    has their own character that is to be admired. When you buy handmade, you are buying 
                    a commitment of authenticity, a guarantee that no other piece will ever be the same.</dd>
                    <dt>10. HANDMADE IS BETTER FOR YOUR CONSCIENCE.</dt>
                    <dd>You are more aware of how your actions influence the bigger picture. Not supporting 
                    mass market products, unethical sourcing or low cost labour. You are supporting peoples 
                    livelihoods with a responsible decision to redistributing wealth.
